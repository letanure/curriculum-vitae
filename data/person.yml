resumeHeadline:
  - Experienced front-end developer living in Berlin that loves create products and all about development

resumeProfile:
  - Detail-oriented professional with thirteen years of experience as a software developer. 
  - Focused on web/mobile applications, using HTML5/CSS, pure Javascript or frameworks like  React, Angular, VueJS, jQuery, also with good skills in NodeJs, Ruby, and PHP and other related technologies
  - Excellent written and oral communication skills

about:
  - Working with web development since 2002, initially as a full-stack PHP programmer, before there was the separation of back and front end.
  - In 2010 I moved to SÃ£o Paulo to work at UOL as front-end and from then I specialized in this area, because I like the technologies and the boom of new methods and frameworks that have emerged.
  - My work is often more focused on the Javascript, but always contribute to other teams, from the definition of product and features, the possibilities and improvements in design, showing new tools, methods and references, building POCs and teaching what I know to my colleagues.
  - I like the whole process of front-end development, well-structured and modularized HTML code, to the implementation of a CSS layout with well done and pixel-perfect code, through accessibility, performance and concern for SEO.
